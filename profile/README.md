On the mission of building the **Stellar Passport**: a reusable, unified identity layer for the Stellar ecosystem. 
Built during HackMeridian 2025

---
## ⚠️ The Problem

- **Fragmented KYC** → every app runs its own checks, forcing users to re-verify again and again.  
- **High Risk** → 80% chance of data breaches when companies handle KYC in-house.  
- **Bots & AI** → over 40% of internet traffic is non-human, threatening fair access to rewards, credit, and governance.  
- **Compliance Failures** → 30% of providers were fined in 2024 for mishandling identity.  
- **Competitive Pressure** → Ethereum has Gitcoin Passport, Polygon has Polygon ID - Stellar risks falling behind.
